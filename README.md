3D Hexagonal Grid Terrain Maker

A C# Library for creating hex-grid-based terrain in a very particular style that I find beautiful.

<sup> An example rendering of a grid generated by this library. Random colors have been added to distinguish hexagons, and hexes taller than 1 height unit have been painted black. </sup>

My goal for this library is to allow users to approximate any function or existing terrain by supplying a sampling function
`(x, y) => z`.

I must admit this 0th version is not very usable yet but at least it can produce rough examples of the types of grids I want to make! :)
