3D Hexagonal Grid Terrain Maker

A C# Library for creating hex-grid-based terrain in a very particular style that I find beautiful.

<sup> An example rendering of a grid generated by this library. Random colors have been added to distinguish hexagons, and hexes taller than 1 height unit have been painted black. </sup>

<sup> The same grid viewed from above. </sup>

with this library, users can approximate any heightmap by supplying a function for sampling the height at any point (x, y)
`(x, y) => z`.

I am finally satisfied with the geometry, and now there is so much more I want to do! :)
